#### Question 1

I'm always looking forward to learn more and improve my knowledge and
skills. I like to challenge myself with using my knowledge to create
new software or invent new stuff which people shall use and remember
me by. Obtaining a job position which allow me to take pleasure from
working is my main professional life goal.

I become a senior back-end developer at 18 and it was suprising to
others and promising for myself which built my confidence and I
believed that everything is possible.

I have a lot of idea but I always build ones that make me think about
2 days and one of them is *jhop*. I solve a katta almost everyday to
keep my brain fresh during the week.

I worked on various projects based on Iran, Australia and Germany. One
of intersting ons was MailPlus which I reverse engineered the
Australia Post API in just one week that impressed my boss and he gave
me a gift card and two days off :D also I changed how RoundTableApps
application were created suggesting to use `dry-validation` to
validate JSON schemas and using simple RubyOnRails API instead of
Grape (which was good with a lot of magic that made junior developers
crazy) and `active_model_serializers` + `oj` for fast
serializing/deserializing. Also I've managed morning meetings when leads
were absent (or tired :D).
