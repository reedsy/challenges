# About Me

I am Dan Watson, a bit of a ruby and rails old timer working predominately in ruby since the rails beta days. In my spare time, I am an avid musician and enjoy playing in a local band. A bit of a claim to fame is I once got to play with Van Morrison!

I have included my CV in this folder so you can get a better gauge of the projects and professional experience I have, but one of my major achievements was implementing a standalone system within the NHS (National Health Service - UK). It's not easy to integrate into such an environment due to the tight security and architectural requirements.  We created a system to track treatments for a specific disease, with the system recommending further treatment options based on patient information. It put a new emphasis on code testing for me as every line of code was potentially making decisions that could end up having a positive or adverse effect on a person health.
